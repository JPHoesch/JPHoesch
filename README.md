- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jake Hoeschen, a systems engineer by trade (but this is my personal account).
- ðŸ”­ Basically all of my coding has been done under enterprise accounts or other hosts or CMs. Mostly here to follow other repos. 
- âš¡ GitHub relevent hobbies include home automation, FPV drones, Tesla projects, VR, ML/NNs, 3d printing, and computer graphics.
- ðŸ“· My profile photo is a picture I took of a total eclipse in 2017. I aboslutely recommend trying to see one of these in person!
