- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jake Hoeschen, a systems engineer by trade (but this is my personal account).
- ðŸ”­ Basically all of my coding has been done under enterprise accounts or other hosts or CMs.
- âš¡ Lately I've been interested in home automation, FPV drones, Tesla API, VR, ML/NNs, 3d printing, computer graphics, computational photography, and SCUBA!
- ðŸ“· My profile photo is a picture I took of a total eclipse in 2017. I aboslutely recommend trying to see one of these in person :)
